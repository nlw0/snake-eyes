Snake Eyes
===

Snake Eyes is an artificial dataset for image analysis research. It was first published at [https://www.kaggle.com/nicw102168/snake-eyes|Kaggle], where you may be able to find more information and useful discussions.

The images resamble thrown dice, but with modified patterns. They were produced by rendering a geometric model given only the paramerers of face, position and orientation of each die. The small resolution and large volume --- one million 20Ã—20 images --- was intended to allow a full exploration of the actual three or six-dimentional manifolds created in the image space by changing these continuous parameters for each face combination.
